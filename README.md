# ðŸ“– Image-Classifier <a name="about-project"></a>


**Image Classifier** In this project, I developed an image classification application that trains a deep learning model using a dataset of images. The application is designed to classify new images based on the model's training.
Specifically, I trained an image classifier to recognize various species of flowers, utilizing a dataset that includes 102 distinct flower categories.
